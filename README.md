**Nice to see you here. You being here, means you are ready to become a frontend hero in an enterprise project. This workshop will help you kick start your career as a frontend developer and teach you the most important technologies of a modern frontend stack.**

This is the repository with a collection of usefull exercises that give you first hands on experiences on a simplified version of a modern frontend stack. This repository contains the following exercises:



### Web development basics

In this exercise we are going to create a hero website. We are going to learn how to structure our HTML page, use CSS to style it and use some JavaScript to add logic to our page.



### Developer tools

In this exercise we will encounter a finished version of the first exercise. But we included some bugs. It's your job to use the dev tools to track down and fix those bugs.



### Sass and TypeScript

In this exercise we will enrich our application with Saas and TypeScript. We will learn what it needs to convert CSS to Sass and JavaScript to TypeScript. Furthermore we are going to learn how to compile Sass to CSS and TypeScript to JavaScript.



### Npm scripts - watch

In this exercise we will use npm in our project. We learn how to create a new `package.json`, how to install dev dependencies and how to add new scripts that automatically compile Sass and TypeScript while we are developing.



### Npm scripts - build

In this exercise we will learn how to correctly install dependencies in a existing repository with a `package.json`. We will furthermore add some more development scripts and add add a build task. This task will build our application so that we could move the output to a webserver and deliver into production.
