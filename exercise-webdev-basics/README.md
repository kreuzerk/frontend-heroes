# Exercise web development basics

In this exercise we are going to create a website which displays heroes. In the end the website should look like this:

To create this web application we are going to use the technologies we previously learned about:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript



## HTML

Let's start by creating an HTML page. We already created an `index.html`. 
Head over to this file and go through the `TODO` items. 
Once finished come back to this file and continue with the CSS section.

## CSS

At this point our page already has some styles, but the layout is not yet correct. 
Let's use some flexbox to fix this. 
Also, we will use the CSS `:hover` selector to change the hover styles of our button. 
Again, open `styles.css` file go through the `TODO` items. 
Once finished come back and continue with the JavaScript section.

## JavaScript

Okay our page looks nice but isn't doing anything yet. 
To add logic to our page we will add a couple of lines of JavaScript. 
Again find and implement the `TODO` items in the `main.js` file.
