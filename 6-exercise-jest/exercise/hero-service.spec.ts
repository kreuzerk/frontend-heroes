     The callHero method accepts an index and an array of heroes. It will then return a string
     that concatenates "Calling hero" and the name of the hero at the given index.
     So for example, if the index is 0, it will return "Calling hero Batman".
     If the index is out of bounds, it will return "No hero at this index".

    The calculateHeroMissions method
    accepts an array of heroes. It will then return an object that contains
    the number of missions each hero has completed. So for example, if the
    input is ['Batman', 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Superman'], it will return
